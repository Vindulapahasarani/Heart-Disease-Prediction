Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. Heart disease is a significant global health concern, and early prediction can aid in timely intervention and treatment. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of heart disease.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features.
Model Selection: Implementation and comparison of multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for improved performance using GridSearchCV.

Requirements
To run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
